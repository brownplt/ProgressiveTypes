TO DO:
[x] Define soundness
  [x] Define progress
  [x] Define preservation
[x] Prove Substitution
[x] Prove 1-step preservation
  [x] Figure out arithmetrix
  [x] Do application
[x] Prove 1-step progress
[x] Define subtyping
[x] Canonical forms (e.g. Num 0 : T -> TZero <: T)
  - not needed
[x] 5 stupid lemmas for errors that say, e.g.
   if TZero <: T and delta_t(div, T, W, T') then div_0 is in W
   ... etc for each one of the errors
