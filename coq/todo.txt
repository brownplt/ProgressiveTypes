TO DO:
[] Define soundness
  [] Define progress

[/] Prove 1-step preservation
  [x] Figure out arithmetrix

[] Prove 1-step progress
[] Define subtyping
[] Canonical forms (e.g. Num 0 : T -> TZero <: T)
[] 5 stupid lemmas for errors that say, e.g.
   if TZero <: T and delta_t(div, T, W, T') then div_0 is in W
   ... etc for each one of the errors
